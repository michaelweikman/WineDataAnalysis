# WineDataAnalysis

Wine data analysis using https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews.

# Setup
I am using kaggle's api to download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews. In order to run this code you need to instal kaggle using <code>pip install kaggle</code>.
</br>
Then you'll need to create an api_key file by registering on the https://www.kaggle.com. Once you have done that go to <code>> My Account</code> on the top right of the web page and click <code>Create New Api Token</code>. This will generate a file <code>kaggle.json</code> and download it to your downloads folder. You'll need to create a <code>.kaggle</code> folder inside your <code>/User/<Your Username></code> and store the kaggle.json file in that folder. Once you've done this you'll be able to run the code in the notebook file.
